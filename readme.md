# RTFM Examples

- Rust version = nightly-2018-11-21-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# RTFM v0.4.0

Official support for RTFM 0.4.0 for devices (not QEMU emulations) depends on the release on the new version of svd2rust (0.14.0).

I made a "technical arrangement" on my stm32l052 for preliminary support... (Not recommended, no side effects analysis)
